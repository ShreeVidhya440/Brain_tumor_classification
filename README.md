# Brain_tumor_classification
This project uses a Brain MRI image dataset consisting of two classes: Tumor (Positive) and No Tumor (Negative). The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used for classification, which includes multiple convolution layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected dense layers with dropout to prevent overfitting. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to measure precision, recall, and F1-score.
